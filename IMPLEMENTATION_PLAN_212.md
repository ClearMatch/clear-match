# Implementation Plan: Contact-Event Correlation via HubSpot Record IDs

**Issue**: #212 - Correlate contacts with events using HubSpot record IDs  
**Status**: üü° Planning Phase  
**Created**: 2025-08-30

## Overview
Establish correlation between Clay events and contacts using HubSpot record IDs as the linking mechanism.

## Current Understanding

### The Problem
- Clay events **WILL** contain a `contact_record_id` field (HubSpot record ID) - **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**
- Our contacts table needs to store the HubSpot record ID  
- When processing Clay events, we need to lookup contacts by HubSpot record ID

### ‚úÖ Final Clean Clay Event Payload (Contact Fields Removed)
```json
{
  "type": "job-posting",
  "contact_record_id": "135509960392",
  "position": "Software Engineer",
  "job_title": "Staff Software Engineer, Anti-Fraud & Abuse",
  "posted_on": "2025-08-20T20:26:24.673Z",
  "metro_area": "San Francisco Bay Area",
  "company_name": "Augment Code",
  "company_website": "augmentcode.com",
  "job_listing_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/staff-software-engineer-anti-fraud-abuse-at-augment-code-4289213833",
  "company_location": "Palo Alto, California",
  "company_headcount": "111",
  "alert_creation_date": "Tuesday, August 26, 2025"
}
```

**‚úÖ Clean Event-Focused Data**: Only 12 fields, all related to the job posting event
**‚úÖ Contact Correlation Ready**: Contains `contact_record_id` for HubSpot correlation
**‚úÖ All Contact Fields Removed**: No duplicate or contact-specific data

## Database Schema Design

### Events Table Structure (Updated for Clean Clay Payload)

#### üóÉÔ∏è **All Fields as Dedicated Database Columns** (All are queryable)
```sql
-- Event correlation (NEW FIELD)
contact_record_id VARCHAR -- HubSpot record ID for lookup

-- Job posting fields from Clay
position VARCHAR
job_title VARCHAR  
posted_on TIMESTAMP
metro_area VARCHAR
company_name VARCHAR
company_website VARCHAR
company_location VARCHAR
job_listing_url VARCHAR
company_headcount INTEGER
alert_creation_date TIMESTAMP

-- Existing event fields
type VARCHAR
contact_id UUID -- Will be populated via contact_record_id lookup
organization_id UUID
created_at TIMESTAMP
updated_at TIMESTAMP
data JSONB -- Can remain for any additional future fields
```

#### üì¶ **JSONB Column Usage** (Currently minimal)
Since Clay payload is now clean and focused, the JSONB `data` column will be:
- Empty or null for most records
- Available for any future additional fields
- Maintains backward compatibility

#### ‚ùå **Remove from Clay Payload** (Contact data - belongs in contacts table)

**REMOVE THESE SPECIFIC FIELDS FROM CLAY HTTP API BODY:**

**Personal Contact Info:**
- `"first_name": "{{Firstname}}"`
- `"last_name": "{{Lastname}}"` 
- `"Personal_Email": "{{Email}}"`
- `"Work_email": "{{Work Email}}"`
- `"Phone": "{{Phone}}"`
- `"contact_linkedin": "{{Hs Linkedin Url}}"`
- `"contact_location": "{{Location (2)}}"`
- `"contact_hs_url": "{{CRMLink}}"`

**Contact Profile Data:**
- `"School": "{{School}}"`
- `"department": "{{Department}}"`
- `"experience": "{{Experience}}"`
- `"lifecyclestage": "{{Lifecyclestage}}"`

**Contact Relationship Data:**
- `"nurturing": "{{Nurturing Notes}}"`
- `"first_contact_date": "{{Normalized first contact date}}"`
- `"Last_contact_date": "{{Normalized last contact date}}"`
- `"number_of_contact_touchpoints": "{{Num Contacted Notes}}"`
- `"reason_for_looking": "{{Reason For Looking_If Any_}}"`
- `"relationship_type": "{{Relationship Type}}"`
- `"level_connection_post_first_call": "{{Level Of Connection Post Initial Call}}"`

**Total: 17 fields to remove from Clay payload**

## Implementation Action Plan

### ‚úÖ **Phase 0: Clay Payload Cleanup (COMPLETED)**
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - All contact fields removed from Clay payload

**Clay Fields to Delete:**
```
"first_name": "{{Firstname}}",

### Implementation Plan (Ready to Execute)

#### üöÄ **Pre-Implementation Setup**
**Branch Strategy**: 
1. Pull latest from `main` branch
2. Create new branch: `212` (issue number)
3. All implementation work on branch `212`

#### **Implementation Phases**
1. ‚úÖ **Phase 0**: Clean up Clay payload (remove contact fields) - **COMPLETED**

2. ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Database Schema Changes - **COMPLETED**
   - ‚úÖ Add `contact_record_id VARCHAR` to events table  
   - ‚úÖ Add `hubspot_record_id VARCHAR UNIQUE` to contacts table
   - ‚úÖ Create appropriate indexes
   - ‚úÖ Add dedicated columns for Clay fields (`job_title`, `company_headcount`, `alert_creation_date`)

3. ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Research & Update HubSpot Sync - **COMPLETED**
   - ‚úÖ Located existing HubSpot sync code at `/supabase/functions/sync-hubspot/index.ts`
   - ‚úÖ Identified HubSpot API field: `hs_object_id` 
   - ‚úÖ Updated sync to fetch and store `hubspot_record_id`
   - ‚úÖ Deployed updated sync function

4. ‚úÖ **Phase 3**: Update Clay Webhook Processing - **COMPLETED**
   - ‚úÖ Modified webhook to use `contact_record_id` for contact lookup
   - ‚úÖ Added error handling for unmatched contacts (returns 400 error)
   - ‚úÖ Added dedicated columns for all Clay event fields
   - ‚úÖ Enhanced response with correlation details

5. ‚úÖ **Phase 4**: Testing & Validation - **COMPLETED**
   - ‚úÖ All tests pass (236 tests)
   - ‚úÖ ESLint clean, TypeScript compilation successful
   - ‚úÖ Production build successful
   - ‚úÖ Functions deployed to production

### ‚úÖ **Phase 5: Automatic Activity Creation from Events** (COMPLETED)

#### **Objective**
When Clay events are processed and successfully correlated with contacts, automatically create corresponding activities/tasks for follow-up actions.

#### **Requirements**

**Activity Creation Trigger:**
- Create activity when event is successfully processed AND `contact_id` is found
- Link activity to event via `event_id` field  
- Associate activity with contact via `contact_id` field

**Priority Calculation Formula:**
```
activity_priority = min(10, contact_engagement_score √ó event_priority_weight / 10)
```

**Event Priority Weights:**
```javascript
const EVENT_PRIORITIES = {
  'job-posting': 7,
  'funding-event': 8,  
  'layoff': 6,
  'new-job': 5,
  'birthday': 3,
  'none': 1
}

// Priority Modifiers:
// - Recent events (< 7 days): +1
// - Large companies (>1000 employees): +1  
// - Senior positions (title contains "Senior", "Lead", "Principal", "Director"): +1
```

**Generated Activity Fields:**
- `type`: `'follow_up'` (default for event-triggered activities)
- `priority`: Calculated priority (1-10 scale, capped at 10)
- `status`: `'pending'`
- `subject`: Dynamic based on event type and details
- `content`: Event context and suggested follow-up actions
- `due_date`: Event type dependent (job-postings: +2 days, others: +7 days)
- `event_id`: Links back to originating event
- `contact_id`: Links to correlated contact
- `organization_id`: Same as contact's organization
- `created_by`: `null` (system-generated)

#### ‚úÖ **Implementation Tasks** (COMPLETED)

**Function Development:**
- ‚úÖ Create `generateActivityFromEvent()` function in webhook
- ‚úÖ Implement `calculateEventPriority()` with modifiers
- ‚úÖ Create dynamic subject/content generation by event type
- ‚úÖ Add due date calculation logic

**Webhook Integration:**
- ‚úÖ Add activity creation after successful event processing
- ‚úÖ Retrieve contact engagement score during correlation
- ‚úÖ Apply priority calculation formula
- ‚úÖ Handle activity creation failures gracefully (log but don't block event)

**Error Handling:**
- ‚úÖ Fallback priority if contact engagement score missing (use default 5)
- ‚úÖ Log activity creation failures without blocking event processing
- ‚úÖ Validate activity data before insertion

**Testing & Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive test suite for activity generation logic
- ‚úÖ Tests for priority calculation, subject generation, due date calculation
- ‚úÖ All tests passing (246 total, including 10 new activity generation tests)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ ESLint clean

#### **Example Activity Generation**

**Job Posting Event Example:**
```
Subject: "Follow up: Software Engineer opening at Augment Code"
Content: "New job posting detected for this contact. Position: Software Engineer at Augment Code, posted 2025-08-30. Consider reaching out about this opportunity."
Priority: engagement_score(8) √ó event_priority(7) / 10 = 5.6 ‚Üí 6
Due Date: 2 days from event creation
```

**Funding Event Example:**  
```
Subject: "Follow up: Funding event at [Company Name]"
Content: "Funding activity detected for this contact's company. This may indicate growth opportunities and increased hiring needs."
Priority: engagement_score(6) √ó event_priority(8) / 10 = 4.8 ‚Üí 5
Due Date: 7 days from event creation
```

## ‚úÖ Questions Clarified

### üîç Database Schema Questions
1. **Field Type**: ‚úÖ `VARCHAR` - match whatever format `contact_record_id` provides (e.g., "135509960392")

2. **Nullability**: ‚úÖ `NOT NULL` - require HubSpot record ID for all contacts

3. **Uniqueness**: ‚úÖ `UNIQUE` constraint - prevent duplicate HubSpot record IDs

### üîç HubSpot Integration Questions
4. **Current HubSpot Sync**: ‚úÖ Manual sync, need to locate existing code

5. **HubSpot Record ID**: ‚úÖ Not currently fetched, need to implement fetching

6. **Sync Strategy**: ‚úÖ Resync all existing records with new field (full migration)

### üîç Event Processing Questions  
7. **Event-Contact Linking**: ‚úÖ Raise error/report invalid state when contact not found

### üîç Data Migration Questions
8. **Existing Data**: ‚úÖ 12k contacts, HubSpot IDs available via API, backfill required

## Remaining Research Tasks

### üîç **Need to Locate/Research**
- [ ] Find existing HubSpot sync code location
- [ ] Identify HubSpot API field for record ID (`id`, `vid`, `hs_object_id`, etc.)
- [ ] Determine current HubSpot API endpoints in use
- [ ] Sample HubSpot contact API response structure

## Implementation Phases (UPDATED)

### Phase 0: Clay Payload Enhancement (PREREQUISITE)
- [ ] **Request Clay team to add `contact_record_id` field to webhook payloads**
- [ ] Test with sample payload including HubSpot record ID
- [ ] Validate field format and data consistency

### Phase 1: Database Schema & Migration  
- [ ] Add `hubspot_record_id` column to contacts table
- [ ] Create appropriate indexes
- [ ] Update TypeScript types

### Phase 2: HubSpot Integration Update
- [ ] Modify HubSpot sync to fetch record IDs
- [ ] Update contact creation/update logic  
- [ ] Handle existing contacts (backfill strategy)

### Phase 3: Clay Event Processing Enhancement
- [ ] Update event processing to extract `contact_record_id` 
- [ ] Implement contact lookup by `hubspot_record_id`
- [ ] Add fallback logic for missing contacts
- [ ] Handle both old and new payload formats during transition

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for event correlation
- [ ] Test with and without `contact_record_id` field
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Data migration complexity
- Performance impact on event processing
- HubSpot API rate limits during backfill

### Medium Risk  
- Clay event format changes
- Contact duplication issues
- Error handling edge cases

### Low Risk
- TypeScript type updates
- Documentation updates
